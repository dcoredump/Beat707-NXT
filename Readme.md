MIDI Groove Sequencer
---------------------

- 15 Drum Tracks (note on/off, 3 velocity values).
- 1 Accent Track. But each step can be set: Accent Track, Min or Max.
- 8 Note Tracks (note number, 3 velocity values). Steps have the option of Slide, Double and Note Off.
- 30 Songs.
- 64 Patterns per Song.
- 16 Steps on screen, plus ABCD variations for a total of 64 steps.
- Double Steps (in between steps option when editing the steps). Steps are 1/16 and Double-Steps are 1/32.
- MIDI Processor Per Track. EG: Fade In, Fade Out, Fade InOut, Fade OutInt, Random Velocity and more.
- Simple Hardware design, based on the easy to find TM1638 IC based boards. Just search on eBay and you should be able to find several options. We used 3 boards that has 8 x buttons, 8 x LEDs and 8 x LED_Segments. The board uses a single ATmega328 running at 3.3V, one FLASH chip for storage and connections for the TM1638 boards.
- MIDI Input and Output, with Clock Send and Receive (Slave mode too).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How The Software Works
----------------------

- The first board is the main interface. Where it shows the Tempo in BPM and the current Pattern. The top leds, first 4 leds show the beat position and the last 4 leds shows the ABCD pattern variation. Also, beats will blink to bottom dot of the 4th digit from left to right.
- Still in the first board, the first button is Play, second button is Stop. 3rd is - and 4th is +. 5th, when hold, let you force a step to Max, Min or Accent. 6th button, if you press and release, will alternate mirror mode, where all ABCD variations will be edited at once, or not, when disabled. You can also hold it and select the first 4 buttons on the second board to select ABCD variations directly. The 7th button, if you press and release, will go to the next pattern. If you hold, it will show the current selected pattern on the two other boards LEDs. The final button, the 8th one, is for selecting the track been edited. If you select a track twice, it will go to the Note Track, instead of Drum Track.
- Holding button #5 from the first board and selecting the button #7, will open the pattern menu: copy, paste, init. Or selecting button #8 will open the global settings menu.
- Adding steps is easy, just click to turn On or Off. By default when you turn a step On it will use the Accent track (last track). Or you can hold button #5 from the left board and turn a step On: Max, Min and Accent. Holding a step will turn the Double-Step On/Off. The Double-Step uses the same velocity as the regular step it is on. Double-Steps are 1/32 steps.
- The Slide option for the notes work like this: regular notes will turn the previous note Off before turning the new step note On. When Slide is activated for the step, the new Step note On will come Before the previous Step Note Off. So if the target MIDI device supports Glide/Slide it will do just that.

List of required components in order to build your unit
-------------------------------------------------------

- The Main PCB produced by us. You can order on the www.Beat707.com site.
- USB Power for the Main PCB.
- The components required by the board above. Specially the ATmega328 IC and the Flash Memory IC. The ATmega328 runs with the internal Oscillator at 8Mhz and 3.3 VCC operation.
- 3 x TM1638 boards such as this one: https://github.com/Beat707/Beat707-NXT/blob/master/Hardware/TM1638.jpg or from eBay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/400985462447
- A MIDI Cable and a MIDI compatible unit to produce some Audio. EG: a synth keyboard or a sound module. As the Beat707 NXT unit itself only produces MIDI, NOT Audio.
- To program the ATmega328 you will also need some sort of ISP programmer. Ordering an UNO based ATmega328 won't do, as it requires 5V and 16Mhz external oscillator to run. The easy way is to order an Arduino UNO and the USB Tiny ISP programmer to program the ATmega328 on the UNO, changing it to run on 3.3V and internal 8Mhz Oscillator.
- The Flash memory is the Winbond W25Q64 BVAIG - DIP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Connecting the boards
---------------------

- From the Main PCB you can see the Main Header, which starts from the top: 5V+, Ground, STB (Strobe), CLK (Clock), Data 1, data 2 and Data 3.
- Now, the first 4 pins are shared on all the 3 x TM1638 boards. While Data 1 is for the first board (on the left) DIO pin, data 2 is for the middle board DIO pin and finally Data 3 for the last (on the right) board DIO pin.
- The best thing is to remove the J1 headers from the TM1638 boards and just pass wires from behind the board.

Main Header (top to bottom)
---------------------------

- 5V+
- GND (Ground)
- STB (Strobe)
- CLK (Clock)
- Data 1 (DIO pin from the board on the left)
- Data 2 (DIO pin from the middle board)
- Data 3 (DIO pin from the board on the right)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BOM (Build Of Materials) List for the Main PCB
----------------------------------------------
- 1x ATmega328P-PU DIP - 8-Bit Microcontroller (using the internal 8Mhz Oscillator at 3.3V)
- 1x W25Q64 DIP - 8Mbit Flash Memory Chip (3.3V)
- 1x 4N35 DIP - Octopler
- 1x 1k Ohm Resistor
- 1x 10k Ohm Resistor
- 1x 200 Ohm Resistor
- 1x 10 Ohm Resistor
- 1x 33 Ohm Resistor
- 1x 1N4748 Diode
- 2x Female Din-5 - MIDI Connector
- 1x 47uf Electrolitic Capacitor
- 4x 100nF Ceramic Capacitor
- 1x LD33V - 3.3V Voltage Regulator
- 1x Female USB-B Connector
- 3x Male Jumpers
- 6x Male Headers for the FTDI Connection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming the ATmega328 IC
----------------------------

- The board requires an ATmega328 IC that has been set to use its internal oscillator. So you can't just get one that has the UNO Bootloader. You will need to use an ISP programmer and connect to the ATmega328 IC and set the correct FUSES so it uses the internal 8Mhz Oscillator in order to run at 3.3V.
- One way to do this is to use the cheap USB Tiny ISP programmer and connect it to an Arduino Board which uses a DIP ATmega328, not the SMD ones.
- To set the right fuses, use the following command: avrdude -p ATMEGA328P -c usbtiny -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m -U hfuse:w:0xda:m -U efuse:w:0x05:m -C "Arduino IDE PATH\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf"
- Be sure to change "Arduino IDE PATH" to the correct location. In the command above I used the usbtiny programmer. Change the name for the one you are using.
- This must be done only one time. Now to upload to the board you can select "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini" and set to "ATmega328 8Mhz 3.3V" in the options. Only worry about the Bootloader if you plan to use the board FTDI connection.
